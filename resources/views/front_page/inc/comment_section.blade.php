                                                    When designers create products, they tell stories to users. Designers have a lot of tools to make a story more interesting. Motion design is one of the most powerful tools designers have. The true power of motion can be seen in mobile experiences. A mobile app without motion is just a sequence of independent screens. But when designers introduce motion, something magical happens – a design comes alive – an app becomes an interactive story that can engage users.
